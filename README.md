Final Project for SD: Game Development with Android Studio

This paticular game psudo randomly pulls simple development questions from each specific static category. User answers are gathered, checked and scored through the use of intents. '..Answers' and '...Questions' arrays hold more data than is applicable to one game session, giving the app replayability for returning users.
